# Burger Builder

This project was made during my React learning phase, it's part of the ['React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)'](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course, taught by the great instructor Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

As I was following along the modules, I tried to introduce some new libraries and add my flavour to the project, like styled-components and formik (with yup) to try and learn something new.
